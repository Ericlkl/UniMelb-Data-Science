### Subject Reviews:
**Foundations of Computing**:  
- Subject is run well both semesters, and is a great introduction to Python and Computer Science
- Not crammable. If you want to do well you have to consistently grind and practice it (like maths)

**Foundations of Algorithms**:  
- Introduction to basic sorting algorithms, and C
- Makes you appreciate memory management in Python because of bloody `malloc`
- Tutors are amazing and of high quality

**Elements of Data Processing**:  
- Lecturer was a joke with one of the lowest SES feedback
- Absolutely no "active replies" on the discussion forumn (dead for weeks)
- Assignments were terribly managed
- If you know how to use `pandas` and jupyter notebook, try get this subject waived

**Database Systems**:
- Lecturer (although is still a bit new) is very clear and passionate about teaching
- If you pay attention, you can expect to do well
- 1st assignment is a bit iffy since it's conceptual, but the rest is very useful (used all the skills in a workplace)
- The intuition will help you for ML, AI, and any Data Science related job (knoweldge of SQL)

**Algorithm Data Structures**:
- By far the best 2nd year COMP subject
- Goes through all the great algorithms, _including_ path-finding algorithms (unlike Design of Algorithms which covers hashing instead)
- Assignments are great fun, and after FoA you should be experienced in C to enjoy it
- If you took Engineering Computation instead of FoA, you're gonna suffer a lot...

**Artificial Intellgience**:
- First third of the lectures are review of basic search algorithms (ADS students will find it a breeze)
- Assignments ARE AMAZINGLY FUN
- Hard and conceptual tutorial questions (although there is no full solution), is quite useful in expanding your problem solving
- Notation for Probability (YES PROB IS IN THE SUBJECT) uses logical AND/OR/NOT, so you have been warned

**Machine Learning:**
- Subject has no maths pre-req, but they attempt to cover "Linear Statistical Models" in 1 lecture. (_I'm not joking it was aids_)
- Discussion forumn is dead (same as EoDP)
- Head tutor was one of the most incompetant ever. If you're used to the algo subjects, this one is full of suffering. The head tutor broke online submissions for a whole 2 days for Assignment 2
- The normal lectruer is great, given that the maths is not a pre-req (at least tries to make it interesting). However, he was sick for a vast majority of the time I took the subject so my experience may be a bit bias...
- First assignment is a joke if you have done maths, but the second is a lot more interesting

**Maths Subjects**:
- They're all well run
- Probability is a big jump (if you didn't do Real Analysis or AM1/AM2) so prepare to grind
- Have yet to find anything bad about the lecturers / lectures and content
- Yao-Ban is the best lecturer (you'll have him for LSM)
