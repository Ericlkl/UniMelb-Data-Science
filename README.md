## Welcome!
Hi, this repository is created to give a taste of what the UniMelb Data Science major (undergraduate) is like. All core subjects, as well as the electives that I took will be provided.

If you're looking for subject content, some of the following are provided:
- Lecture Notes
- Past Exams / MSTs
- Textbooks (for some math subjects only)
- Assignments (for some CIS subjects only)

The core subjects will be _italicised_ and the handbook can be [viewed here](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2019/components/b-sci-major-8)

## About Me
- I'm currently a 3rd year undergrad majoring in Data Science.
- Lab demonstrator for Foundations of Computing (COMP10001) and Algorithm & Data Structures (COMP20003).
- Spatial Data Analyst Intern at UniMelb Infrastructure Services.

### Computing & Information Systems (CIS) Subjects:
- _Foundations of Computing_ (COMP10001) - (75)
- _Foundations of Algorithms_ (COMP10002) - (79)
- _Database Systems_ (INFO20008) - (78)
- _Elements of Data Processing_ (COMP20004) - (84)
- Algorithm Data Structures (COMP20003) - (85)
- Artificial Intelligence (COMP30024) - (XX)
- _Machine Learning_ (COMP30027) - (XX)
- Declarative Programming (COMP30020) - (XX)

### Math Subjects
There's a lot more maths than you think (the major shares the same core maths as Actuarial Science up to second year), and so I highly recommend you take either AM1 / AM2 or Real Analysis, or Probability will be a hard leap.
- _Calculus 2_ (MAST10006)
- _Linear Algebra_ (MAST10007)
- _Probability_ (MAST20004)
- _Statistics_ (MAST20005)
- _Linear Statistical Models_ (MAST30025)
- _Modern Applied Statistics_ (MAST30027)
- _Applied Data Science_ (MAST30034)

### Breadth / Other Subjects
- Japanese 3 (JAPN10007)
- Physics 1 (PHYC10003)
- Fundamentals of Chemistry (CHEM10007)
- Engineering Systems Design 2 (ENGR10003)
- Music in the Culture of the Renaissance (MUSI30011)
- High Baroque Music of the German World (MUSI30014)
- Music Health (MUSI20150)
- Science and Internship Program (SCIE30002)
- Positive Leadership and Careers (EDUC30072)

## Subject Reviews
**Foundations of Computing**:  
- Subject is run well both semesters and is a great introduction to Python and Computer Science.
- Not crammable. If you want to do well, you have to consistently grind and practice it (like maths).
- I recommend you waive this (and possibly FoA) if you did VCE algorithms, but otherwise do it.

**Foundations of Algorithms**:  
- Introduction to basic sorting algorithms and the C programming language.
- Makes you appreciate memory management in Python because of bloody `malloc`.
- Tutors are amazing and can actually teach. (Shout out to my tutor Alex Zable).
- Usually the make it or break it point for CompSci/DataSci students.
- Learn to use `valgrind` if you don't want `Segmentation Faults`

**Elements of Data Processing**:  
- This was **THE** biggest joke of a subject (in a bad way).
- Lecturer presumably got a very low SES feedback because she was fired since it was so badly run.
- Absolutely no reply from the lecturers / tutors on the discussion forum for weeks.
- Assignments / Labs / Tutorials had little correlation with the lecture content.
- If you know how to use `pandas` and jupyter notebook, **try your hardest** to get this subject waived.
- **EDIT**: apparently the old lecturer is back which should hopefully revive this subject.

**Database Systems**:
- Reneta / David are the lecturers, and both are very clear and passionate about teaching.
- Reneta is actually good once you get used to her accent trust me.
- The theory content is very useful, and the concepts taught are very applicable in real life jobs.
- 1st assignment is a bit iffy since it's a conceptual diagram of an ER-Model
- The intuition will help you for ML, AI, and any Data Science or Data Analytics position.

**Algorithm Data Structures**:
- By far the best 2nd year COMP subject ever (better alternative to Design of Algorithms)
- Goes through all the great algorithms, _including_ path-finding algorithms (unlike DoA which covers hashing and compression instead)
- Assignments are great fun, and after FoA you should (hopefully) be experienced enough in C to appreciate it.
- If you're rusty on C don't worry, first few lectures is revision (we recover `malloc` as well for eng comp kids8)
- The 2018 Exam question about electrical outages landed me a Graduate offer at EssentialEnergy (ayyyy)
- If you took Engineering Computation instead of FoA, you're going to suffer a lot...

**Artificial Intelligence**:
- First third of the lectures are review of basic search algorithms (ADS students will find it a breeze).
- Assignments ARE AMAZINGLY FUN.
- Tutors and lectures are ACTUALLY GOOD.
- Hard and conceptual tutorial questions (although there is no full solution) but are quite useful in expanding your problem solving.
- Notation for Probability (YES PROB IS IN THE SUBJECT) uses logical AND/OR/NOT, so you have been warned.
- Do yourself a favour and take the subject!!!!

**Machine Learning: **
- Subject has no maths pre-req, but they attempt to cover "Linear Statistical Models" in 1 lecture. (_I'm not joking it was aids_)
- Discussion forum is dead (same as EoDP).
- The usual lecturer is great, given that the maths is not a pre-req (at least tries to make it interesting). However, he was sick for a vast majority of the time I took the subject so my experience may be a bit more biased to the worse side.
- A lot of content was attempted to be covered and felt a bit too ambitious given that the maths was not pre-req.
- First assignment is a joke if you have done maths, but the second is a **lot more** interesting.
- Quoting my tutor: _"this subject is a money grabber because no one would take this subject if Probability was an actual pre-req".
- Tim Baldwin saved us for the exam lecture <3

**Maths Subjects**:
- They're all well run
- Probability is a big jump (if you didn't do Real Analysis or AM1/AM2) so prepare to grind
- Have yet to find anything bad about the lecturers / lectures and content
- Yao-Ban is the best lecturer (you'll have him for LSM)
